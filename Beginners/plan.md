### **Updated Plan for Python for Beginners (Detailed, 2.5 hours)**

---

### **1. Introduction to Python (10 minutes)**  
   - **What is Python?**  
     - High-level, versatile, and easy to learn.  
   - **Why Learn Python?**  
     - Examples: Web Development (Django/Flask), Data Science, AI/ML.  
   - **Setting Up Python**  
     - Install Python & IDE (VSCode setup with extensions).
   - **How Python Works**  
     - Python interpreter → Execute code interactively.

---

### **2. Python Basics (40 minutes)**  
**a. Hello World & Syntax (10 minutes)**  
   - Writing your first Python program (`print("Hello, World!")`)  
   - Python is indentation-sensitive → Importance of clean code  
   - Comments: Single-line (`#`) and multi-line (`"""`)  

**b. Variables and Data Types (15 minutes)**  
   - Declaring variables and dynamic typing  
   - **Data Types:** `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `NoneType`  
   - Type conversion: `str()`, `int()`, `float()`  

**Mini Exercise:** Calculate age from year of birth.  

**c. Input & Output (10 minutes)**  
   - `input()` for user interaction  
   - `print()` with string concatenation and f-strings  

**Mini Project: Expense Tracker** (5 minutes)  
   - Input income and expenses → Calculate remaining balance.  

---

### **3. Operators in Python (15 minutes)**  
   - **Arithmetic Operators:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`  
   - **Comparison Operators:** `==`, `<`, `>`, `!=`  
   - **Logical Operators:** `and`, `or`, `not`  

**Mini Exercise:** Write a program to compare two numbers and print the larger one.  

---

### **4. Control Flow (40 minutes)**  
**a. Conditional Statements (20 minutes)**  
   - `if`, `elif`, and `else` explained with examples  
   - Nested conditions  

**Mini Project: Simple Calculator**  
   - Take two numbers and perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division based on user input.

**b. Loops (20 minutes)**  
   - **For Loop:** Use with `range()`, iterating through lists.  
   - **While Loop:** Demonstrate a countdown timer.  
   - Use of `break` and `continue`.  

**Mini Exercise:** Print all odd numbers between 1 and 20.  

---

### **5. Data Structures (Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries) (40 minutes)**  
**a. Lists (20 minutes)**  
   - Creating, accessing, and slicing lists.  
   - Adding (`append()`), removing (`pop()`), and sorting.  
   - Iterating with loops.  

**b. Tuples (10 minutes)**  
   - Immutable nature of tuples.  
   - Accessing and slicing tuples.  

**c. Dictionaries (10 minutes)**  
   - Key-value pairs → Adding, updating, and deleting keys.  

**Mini Project: Shopping Cart**  
   - Add/remove items, display cart total.  

---

### **6. Functions in Python (20 minutes)**  
   - Defining reusable functions  
   - Parameters, arguments, and return values  
   - Default parameters  

**Mini Project: Temperature Converter**  
   - Convert Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit.  

---

### **7. Error Handling (10 minutes)**  
   - Importance of handling errors gracefully.  
   - `try-except` blocks → Handle divide-by-zero.  

**Mini Exercise:** Handle invalid input while performing division.  

---

### **8. Final Projects (45 minutes)**  
**a. Number System Converter (20 minutes)**  
   - Input: Decimal, Binary, Octal, Hexadecimal  
   - Convert one format to another  
   - Use `bin()`, `oct()`, `hex()`, `int()` for conversions.

**b. Wordle Game (25 minutes)**  
   - Choose a random word from a list.  
   - Allow the user 6 attempts to guess it.  
   - Provide feedback on correct letters and their positions.

---

### **9. Conclusion (5 minutes)**  
   - Recap what was covered.  
   - Encourage viewers to practice mini-projects and build more.  
   - Tease Intermediate and Advanced videos (e.g., File Handling, OOP, APIs).
